# Welcome to the world of Android Development!{docsify-ignore-all}
For beginners, we will learn the basic concepts of
programming using Java and Kotlin.

For intermediate/advanced Android developers, let's share the knowledge and build apps together!

If you have questions, please feel free to ask and participate on our [discussion
board](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Manila/messages/boards/forum/24291952).

## Study Group Setup 
* Resources such as notes, exercises and samples will be uploaded here and in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B5e6z53Ajo7AcFFzRGVOZk1qSnM)
* Our 1.5 hours will be divided randomly into:
    - Introduction/Getting to know first-timers
    - Discuss questions/issues raised on discussion board
    - Lightning Talk (anyone who wants to share/chikka something!)
    - Self-paced or mini study session
    - Today I Learned (TIL)
    - Announcement
