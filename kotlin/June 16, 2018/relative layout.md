
# Relative Layout

**RelativeLayout** is a view group that displays child views in relative positions. 

The position of each view can be specified as relative to sibling elements (such as to the left-of or below another view) or in positions relative to the parent RelativeLayout area (such as aligned to the bottom, left or center).
